By using a pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL) module, applied T<sub>1,blood</sub>*ln(2) seconds before VS-labeling, the arterial signal will be nulled. Therefore the MR signal will be exclusively from blood flowing above a cutoff velocity (v<sub>c</sub>) on the venous side of the circulation. This new method, dubbed Inflow QUIXOTIC (IQ), was compared to QUantitative Imaging of eXtraction of Oxygen and TIssue Consumption (QUIXOTIC)  

By selectively labeling the venous blood pool, the IQ-technique showed a great improvement in SNR and difference signal compared to QUIXOTIC. IQ-OEF enables selection of the local venous blood pool, and provides also the opportunity to not only estimate the venous, but also the arterial T2 in a single scan.
