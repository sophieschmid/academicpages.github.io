After my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at the Technical University Eindhoven (TU/e), I started my PhD research at the CJ Gorter Center for high field MRI of the Leiden University Medical Center in February 2011. My main research topics are the development and optimization of arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion techniques, such as acceleration selective ASL (AccASL), time encoded pseudo continuous ASL (te-pCASL) and new oxygen extraction fraction measurement techniques, that enable the detection and characterization of small vessel disease. This work resulted in my PhD thesis entitled "[Arterial spin labeling in space and time : new MRI sequences to probe cerebral hemodynamics](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/49562)."

In February 2015 I started studying the cerebrovacular reactivity in Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage With Amyloidosis – Dutch type (HCHWA-d), also known as the Katwijk disease, a hereditary form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The vessels in the brain were challenged with CO2 and visual stimulation at 3T MRI and compared between patients with HCHWA-d and age and gender matched healthy controls to get insight in the effect of the amyloid deposition in the cerebrovasculature and the reactivity of the vessels. This study is part of the CAVIA project, which has been made possible by ZonMW, part of the Dutch national 'Deltaplan for Dementia'.

In January 2018 I won the Out of the Box challenge at the ISMRM Benelux Chapter meeting, which enabled me to develop a new ASL technique to selectively label the venous blood pool in the brain for oxygen extraction fraction measurements.  

Currently I am working on my Veni project “Challenging the elderly brain” (NWO project number 17319) , which has the overal goal to assess the changes in the vasculature that occur in aging with MRI and relate those to cognitive decline and anatomical changes in the brain. With arterial spin labeling (ASL) not only the perfusion of the brain can be measured without the use of contrast agents, but provides also important opportunities to measure other aspects of the cerebral hemodynamics. Therefore I want to develop and optimize ASL techniques that enable the detection and characterization of the microvasculature beyond the standard cerebral blood flow.
