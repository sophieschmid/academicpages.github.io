After her Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at the Technical University Eindhoven (TU/e), Sophie Schmid started her PhD research at the CJ Gorter Center for high field MRI of the Leiden University Medical Center in February 2011. Her main research topics are the development and optimization of arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion techniques, like acceleration selective ASL (AccASL), time encoded pseudo continuous ASL (te-pCASL) and new oxygen extraction fraction measurement techniques, that enable the detection and characterization of small vessel disease. This work resulted in her PhD thesis entitled "[Arterial spin labeling in space and time : new MRI sequences to probe cerebral hemodynamics](https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/49562)."

In February 2015 she started studying the cerebrovacular reactivity in Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage With Amyloidosis â€“ Dutch type (HCHWA-d), also known as the Katwijk disease, a hereditary form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The vessels in the brain were challenged with CO2 and visual stimulation at 3T MRI and compared between patients with HCHWA-d and age and gender matched healthy controls to get insight in the effect of the amyloid deposition in the cerebrovasculature and the reactivity of the vessels. This study is part of the CAVIA project, which has been made possible by ZonMW, part of the Dutch national 'Deltaplan for Dementia'.

In January 2018 she won the Out of the Box challenge at the ISMRM Benelux Chapter meeting, which enabled her to develop a new ASL technique to selectively label the venous blood pool in the brain for oxygen extraction fraction measurements.
