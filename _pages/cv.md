Employment
======
* Post doctoral fellow at LUMC (Dec 2019 - present)
The overall goal of my project is to assess the changes in the vasculature that occur in aging with MRI and relate those to cognitive decline and anatomical changes in the brain. With arterial spin labeling (ASL) not only the perfusion of the brain can be measured without the use of contrast agents, but provides also important opportunities to measure other aspects of the cerebral hemodynamics. Therefore I want to develop and optimize ASL techniques that enable the detection and characterization of the microvasculature beyond the standard cerebral blood flow. 

This work is supported by the research program Innovational Research Incentives Scheme Veni with project number 17319, “Challenging the elderly brain”, of S. Schmid, which is financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).

* Post doctoral researcher at LUMC (Feb 2018 - Nov 2019)
Research on developing a multi-slice method to measure the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) at tissue level, which could an provide unique possibilities to assess the hemodynamic status and the autoregulation of the brain. Furthermore, velocity selective arterial spin labeling is implemented at 7 Tesla. 

This work is supported by the research program Innovational Research Incentives Scheme Vici with project number 016.160.351 of M.J.P. van Osch, which is financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and a personal grant for winning the ISMRM Benelux Out of the Box challenge 2018.

* Post doctoral researcher at LUMC (Feb 2015 - Jan 2018)
Research on the influence of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) on the cerebrovascular reactivity measured with MRI in patients with Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage With Amyloidosis – Dutch type (HCHWA-D), part of ZonMW Memorabel, “CAVIA: Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy: Vascular Imaging and fluid markers of Amyloid deposition”, nr. 733050202

* PhD candidate at LUMC (Feb 2011 - Jan 2015)
Research on the microvasculature in the brain with MRI arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques like velocity-selective ASL, acceleration selective ASL en time-encoded ASL, part of STW-project, “Imaging the roots of brain disease: Probing micro-vascular pathology by ASL MRI”, nr. 11047
