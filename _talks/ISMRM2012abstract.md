The introduction of Acceleration selective arterial spin labeling (AccASL), which is a spatially non-selective ASL method that labels spins based on the flow acceleration, opposed to the traditional ASL methods that label based on spatial location. Therefore, label is also created within the imaging region. 

A comparison was made between the traditional pseudo continuous ASL (pCASL) and the existing spatially non-selective ASL methods: single and dual velocity selective ASL (VSASL).

The proposed AccASL is a promising method to enable measurement of the perfusion in the brain with the advantages of dual VS-ASL to label spatially non-selectively (and therefore doesn't suffer from transit delay artifacts) and to eliminate venous label, and of pCASL to provide a high signal in gray matter.
