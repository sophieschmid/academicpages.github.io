In this study we employed Time encoded (aka. Hadamard encoded) pseudo Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling combined with T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging to evaluate the hemodynamics of the posterior and middle cerebral artery border zone regions in the brains of healthy, young volunteers. A significantly lower CBF was found in the border region compared with the central region in both the posterior and MCA flow territory. The arterial transit time in the border zone is significantly longer compared to the central region. However, the exchange of the label from the arterial to the tissue compartment appears to be at a similar rate.
