The aim of this study is to employ a method to measure the transverse relaxation time as a function of the inflow time and to distinguish 
spin compartments based on their T2 in a highly time-efficient and voxelwise manner. By the use of Time encoded (also known as Hadamar 
encoded) pseudo Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling (te-pCASL) in combination with T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) it is feasible 
to be more specific due to the short bolus duration and reduce the measurement time, while still keeping an equal SNR compared to separate 
multi-timepoint pCASL scans.

The use of te-pCASL combined with TRUST gives a highly time-efficient way to calculate the T2, and distinguish the location of the
spins between the arterial and GM tissue compartments
