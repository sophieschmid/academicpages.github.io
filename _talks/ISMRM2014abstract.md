For AccASL it is unknown where in the vascular tree label is created. The aim of this study was to get more insight into the origin of the label mechanism in AccASL by combining this method with a VS module. Summing the signal of AccASL and VS-ASL acquired separately was compared with AccASL and VS-ASL acquired immediately after each other. The difference in this signal suggests that the label from AccASL originates from both macro- and micro-vascular level.
